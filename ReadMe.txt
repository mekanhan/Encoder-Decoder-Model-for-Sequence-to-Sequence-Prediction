Attached is rnn.txt, the UML for sequence diagram and the generated diagram.
The rnn.zip contain the LSTM code which I delivered for previous order along with unit test class.
You can run the unit tests by terminal command "python -m unittest unit_test.py".
You have asked to provide a summary of how the model works, I am giving you a link to the webpage
 which I used along with the link that you provided:
 https://stackabuse.com/python-for-nlp-neural-machine-translation-with-seq2seq-in-keras/ .
 From this link, I am using the tokenization part only. The rest is the same as provided in your link.
 And our problem formulation is our own. As I have discussed with you, we are considering only the
 loops of a given code because only loops count in code complexity. Each loop block is considered as
  a single sentence in our solution. If you have any question, please let me know.
  I will try to answer as soon as possible.

Best,
